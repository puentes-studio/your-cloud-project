Your Cloud

This code belongs to the front end of an Online Hard Disk with functionality similar to any cloud storage and file management app.

To start the app, open the console and initialize it with: "npm run dev".

Of course, prior communication with the backend of the project is required, which is located in the server folder along with its instructions.

Once the app is initialized, its operation is quite intuitive.
